<h1>Pro.js</h1>

<hr />

<h4>An <i>open-source</i> JavaScript library</h4> <br />

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<hr />
<p>
    Pro.js is a highly configurable, highly optimized JavaScript library that has a clean, easy-to-use API that should feel right at home for developers of all backgrounds.
    Its clearly namespaced code makes it easy to distinguish key features and their utilization in the library. Whether you just need basic
    features or full DOM support, the separation and namespacing of the code makes it easy for you to integrate only the components of the library
    that you need in your project.
</p>
<p>
    Whether you're new to JavaScript or a JS guru, there's lots to love about the Pro library. Aside from presenting key features to developers,
    it also makes JavaScript development easier, faster, and more predictable with its strong type checking and constraints component. Error handling is a breeze with
    Pro's global error handling, streamlining your application development processes.

                        between your objects.

                <b>Enumerables:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Enumerable is an object in the Pro.Collections namespace that allows for manipulation of JS Arrays with a clean and easy to use API. With its SQL like
                        syntax, using the methods to work on Arrays should be easier than ever before and getting the data you want from your Arrays will feel easier than ever with
                        the Enumerable object.
                        <br />
                        The Pro.Collections.Enumerable object provides a syntax and API similar to C#'s IEnumerable interface. Those coming from a .NET background should find
                        it very easy to work with Pro enumerable object. Even for those who are not familiar with the .NET framework or C# features should feel right at home
                        with the Enumerable object's tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create instances of the Enumerable object easily from JS Arrays with the Pro.Collections.AsEnumerable method and do more with less!
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Creates a KeyValuePair relationship between a key/index and a value and stores it for later retrieval. It makes indexing your objects easier and lookup
                        much faster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implements the Enumerable interface and provides a clean interface for sorting, filtering and manipulating the Dictionary object.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Creates a first in first out implementation of the JS Array and provides a clean and easy to use API to manage the queue.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Creates a last in first out implementation of the JS Array and provides a clean and easy to use API to manage the stack.
                    </li>

                    Document Object Model API:
                </b>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For those coming from a jQuery background, utilizing the Pro.Document object should feel native and easy to use. The Pro.Document API provides many similar functional components
                        - event listeners, dom manipulation, etc. - but implements the Pro.Collections.Enumerable interface to make querying elements on the DOM easier and faster. Being able to use
                        CSS selectors and run filters and sorts on the DOM makes it easier to use the Pro.Document object and uses a highly optimized, native mechanism for finding DOM elements.

                        Documentation on the DOM API will be coming soon...

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Animated scrolling, and general scrolling methods make it easier to navigate your page with a modern look and feel for your users without having to worry about
                                creating your own implementations. A scroll speeds component makes it easy to get the exact feel your looking for in your unique scenarios.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                                Query strings are easier to retrieve than ever with the Pro.Window's location object that provides an easy to use tool to get the query string values by their key.
